    User-Friendly Interface: Clear and concise prompts guide players through the game.
    Customizable Settings: Players can customize certain game settings such as the game board size or the symbols used by players.

This project serves as a beginner-friendly example for implementing a simple game using [programming language]. It can be used for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex game development projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
